# Engineering Practices & Standards Handbook

Welcome to the comprehensive Engineering Practices & Standards Handbook. This repository serves as the central knowledge hub for engineering best practices, standards, and guidelines across all aspects of software development and delivery.

## 🎯 Handbook Overview

This handbook provides structured guidance for engineering teams across:
- **Development Practices** - Coding standards, code review, version control, and testing
- **Architecture & Design** - System architecture, design patterns, and API design
- **Quality Assurance** - Testing strategies, automation, and quality metrics
- **DevOps & Infrastructure** - CI/CD, infrastructure as code, monitoring
- **Security Practices** - Security guidelines, authentication, and data protection
- **Team Processes** - Agile processes, communication, and performance management
- **Standards & Guidelines** - Naming conventions, compliance, and code quality
- **Tools & Technologies** - Technology stacks, tool recommendations, and setup guides
- **Reference Materials** - Templates, checklists, and decision-making resources

## 🚀 Quick Start

### For New Team Members
1. Start with [`NAVIGATION.md`](NAVIGATION.md) for a complete table of contents
